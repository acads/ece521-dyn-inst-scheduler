\section{Important Formulas}
Some of the important formulas that are used to characterize the micro-architecture performance are briefly discussed here.

\subsection{Instructions Per Cycle (IPC)}
As the name suggests, it denotes the average of total number of instructions executed per cycle over a period of time. It is governed by the following formula:

\[IPC = \frac{totalNumInstructions}{totalNumCycles}\]

Though, this formula involves neither the dispatch bandwidth (\textit{n}) nor the scheduling queue size (\textit{s}), both of them affects the overall \textit{IPC} of an architecture. This is explained in more detail in section 5.
