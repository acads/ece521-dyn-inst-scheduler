\section{Introduction}
In this project, a dynamic instruction scheduler using Tomasulo's algorithm has been modeled. All stages of Tomasulo algorithm --- instruction fetch, instruction dispatch, instruction issue, instruction execution, results writeback and instruction retirement has been modeled. The dispatch bandwidth and the reservation stations capacity of the scheduler are configurable. 

Also, a multi-level data cache (L1 and L2) with variable cache size and associativity has been modeled.  This cache configuration uses Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm for aging out older entries.
