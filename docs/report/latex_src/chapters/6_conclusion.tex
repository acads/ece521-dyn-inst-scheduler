\section{Conclusion}
The key takeaway of this project and the accompanying project report is the understanding of out of order instruction execution using Tomasulo's algorithm for dynamic instruction scheduling. The project and the experimental runs were very instrumental in understanding the the performance characteristics of the instruction scheduler and the factors affecting it.
